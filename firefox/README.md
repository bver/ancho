## About

Ancho implementation for hosting Google Chrome extensions in Firefox browser.

## How to use Ancho for Firefox

The target Google Chrome extension is referenced using `chrome-ext` symlink in
this `firefox` directory. Point it to the root of the unpacked extension
directory structure, i.e. where the `manifest.json` file is located.

To use the extension, create a file named `ancho@salsitasoft.com` in
`extensions` directory of your Firefox browser profile with path to this
`firefox` directory as its content. Or, simply create a standard Firefox
extension (the `.xpi` extension file) by zipping this `firefox` directory.  When
doing so, make sure the content of referenced `chrome-ext` directory is included
in the package, i.e. that the symbolic links are followed.

## Current state

The known limitations of the implementation are:

1. The Google Chrome extension API is far from being implemented completely, so
far we have:
  * `chrome...`,
  * `chrome...`,
  * TODO
2. We use CommonJS module structures for authoring Google Chrome extensions.
Since the `require()` function is not implemented natively in Google Chrome
(yet), the first thing we do in both content and background is that we load
script file called `require.js` and after that we load the rest. In Firefox,
however, the `require()` function is implemented differently, so we don``t
need / want to load the `require.js` script from the hosted extension.
Therefore all scripts with name `require.js` are NOT loaded in Firefox. If
you happen to have script with this name in your original extension, and if
this script implements something else than CommonJS `require()` function,
please rename the script and it will be loaded for you.

We work hard to get the Chrome extension API implemented soon.
